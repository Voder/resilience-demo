# resilience-demo

A simple [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) App to experiment with resilience patterns and libs.  
Currently [Netflix Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and [Spring Retry](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry) are combined.

Uses the [demo-service](https://github.com/Voder/demo-service) project as service provider.
